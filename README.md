The Task Board Challenge!

This chalenge has proved very difficult for me. The goal of the challenge is to allow for the end user to create tasks for projects they are working on. The user inputs task information into a modal which is then saved in local storage. 

Using the the readProjectsFromStorage and the printProjectData functions, we are able to create 'Task Cards' and append them to the correct column. From here, we should be able to drag the cards to different columns given the status of the project. 

The ability to drop cards into different columns and have them append to that given target is still not working and will be the priority moving forwards.
